# EngageSDK

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+ / macOS 10.12+ / tvOS 10.0+ / watchOS 3.0+
- Xcode 10.1+
- Swift 4.2+

## Installation

### CocoaPods
Cocoapods is a dependency management platform used to install, update and delete the libraries used on a project.  

You can  install Cocoapods using the following terminal command

```ruby
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To initialize Cocoapods on your project, navigate through the terminal to your project directory and then run the following command:
```ruby
$ cocoapods init
```

This will create a `.podfile` on the root of your project. The `.podfile` is the configuration file that Cocoapods uses to declare the project dependencies. 

Next, add the EngageSDK as a dependency to your project:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'Your Target Name' do
pod 'EngageSDK'
end
```

On the root of your project where the `.podfile` was created, run the following command to install the Discovery SDK as a dependency:

```ruby
$ pod install
```


### Permissions

Engage SDK will need location and bluetooth permissions. Add the following keys to your App plist:  

- NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription
- NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription
- NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription

### Capabilities

On your App capabilities check:  

1. Location Updates
2. Uses Bluetooth LE accessory
3. Act as Bluetooth LE accessory
4. Remote notifications

With all of the above setup, now you're now ready to get Engage up and running!


## Initializing The Framework  

To initialize Engage, add your credentials to the Initialize Call on the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions of your AppDelegate.

```swift
import LocallyEngageSDK
import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

	var window: UIWindow?

	func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

		Engage.initialize(username: "YOUR USERNAME", password: "YOUR PASSWORD")

		return true
	}
}
```
  
  

## Monitoring Beacon Campaigns

After the SDK has been initialized, you can call Engage.startMonitoringBeacons from any place in your app. The initialized closure is used to guarantee that startMonitoringBeacons is called _only_ after the SDK has been initialized.

```swift
Engage.initialized = {
	Engage.startMonitoringBeacons()
}
```
  

## Monitoring Geofence Campaigns

You can monitor Geofence Campaigns in the same way you monitor Beacons. Just call Engage.startMonitoringGeofences:

```swift
Engage.initialized = {
	Engage.startMonitoringGeofences()
}
```

```swift
Engage.initialized = {
	Engage.stopMonitoringBeacons()
}
```

You can also monitor Beacons _and_ Geofences at the same time:

```swift
Engage.initialized = { Engage.startMonitoringBeacons()
	Engage.startMonitoringGeofences()
}
```
## Handling Content

implementing WidgetsPresenterDelegate let you catch when a beacon or geofence campaign are detected
widgets are xib filewith his own viewcontroller that let you present the campaigns content
in a collectionview or whatever you decide
```swift
extension CampaignListViewController: WidgetsPresenterDelegate {
    
    func present(widget: WidgetViewController) {
    	// do something with the widget
        widgets.append(widget)
    }
}
```

## Push Notification Campaigns

### Registering for Push Notifications  
To register for Push Notifications, implement the delegate method "didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken" on your AppDelegate and then set the device token:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
	Engage.deviceToken = deviceToken
}
```

### Displaying Push Notification Preview  
  
####  Creating a Notification Service Extension
To add Push Notifications campaigns to your app, you'll have to add a NotificationServiceExtension to your project:

####  Configuring your Notification Service

Change your NotificationService to call RemoteNotificationPreviewDisplayer by adding the following:

```swift
import LocallyEngageSDK
import UserNotifications
import UserNotificationsUI

class NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension {

	override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
		RemoteNotificationPreviewDisplayer.displayPreview(withNotificationRequest: request, andHandler: contentHandler)
	}
}

``` 

###  Configuring your plist file
Now open the plist file, remove the NSExtensionMainStoryboard key and then set the other keys as illustrated in the image below.

####  Configuring the Notification View Controller

Remove your MainInterface.storyboard file and then change your NotificationViewController to call RemoteNotificationViewController on your viewDidLoad method:

```swift
import LocallyEngageSDK

class NotificationViewController: UIViewController {

	override func viewDidLoad() {
		super.viewDidLoad()
		_ = RemoteNotificationViewController()
	}
}
```
